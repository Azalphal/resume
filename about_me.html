                By not having the imagination to imagine what the content "might" be, a design consideration is
                lost. Meaning becomes obfuscated because "it's just text", understandability gets compromised because
                nobody realized that this text stuff was actually meant to be read. Opportunities get lost because the
                lorem ipsum garbage that you used instead of real content didn't suggest opportunities. The text then
                gets made really small, because, it's not meant to be used, we might as well create loads of that lovely
                white space.
